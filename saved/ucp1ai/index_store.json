CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 3 Another application • A credit card company receives thousands of applications for new cards. Each application contains information about an applicant, • age • Marital status CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 4 • annual salary • outstanding debts • credit rating • etc.  • Problem: to decide whether an application should approved, or to classify applications into two categories, CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 5 approved and not approved.  Machine learning and our focus • Like human learning from past experiences. • A computer does not have “experiences”. • A computer system learns from data, which represent some “past experiences” of an application domain.  • Our focus: learn a target function that can be used to predict the values of a discrete class attribute, e.g., approve or not-approved, and high-risk or low risk.  • The task is commonly called: Supervised learning, classification, or inductive learning.  CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 6 The data and the goal • Data: A set of data records (also called examples, instances or cases) described by • k attributes: A 1 , A 2 , ... A k . • a class: Each example is labelled with a pre-defined class.  • Goal: To learn a classification model from the data that can be used to predict the classes of new (future, or test) cases/instances. An example: data (loan application) Approved or not CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 7   An example: the learning task • Learn a classification model from the data • Use the model to classify future loan applications into • Yes (approved) and • No (not approved) • What is the class for following case/instance?  CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 9 CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 7 Supervised vs. unsupervised Learning • Supervised learning: classification is seen as supervised learning from examples.  • Supervision: The data (observations, measurements, etc.) are labeled with pre-defined classes. It is like that a “teacher” gives the classes (supervision).  • Test data are classified into these classes too.  • Unsupervised learning (clustering) • Class labels of the data are unknown • Given a set of data, the task is to establish the existence of classes or clusters in the data CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 10 Supervised learning process: two steps ◼ Learning (training): Learn a model using the training data ◼ Testing: Test the model using unseen test data to assess the model accuracy Number of correct classifications Accuracy= , Total number of test cases CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 11  What do we mean by learning? • Given • a data set D, • a task T, and • a performance measure M,  a computer system is said to learn from D to perform the task T if after learning the system’s performance on T improves as measured by M.  CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 12 • In other words, the learned model helps the system to perform T better as compared to no learning.  An example • Data: Loan application data • Task: Predict whether a loan should be approved or not. • Performance measure: accuracy. No learning: classify all future applications (test data) to the majority class (i.e., Yes): Accuracy = 9/15 = 60%. CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 13 • We can do better than 60% with learning. Fundamental assumption of learning Assumption: The distribution of training examples is identical to the distribution of test examples (including future unseen examples).  • In practice, this assumption is often violated to certain

In practice, this assumption is often violated to certain degree.  • Strong violations will clearly result in poor classification accuracy.  CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 14 • To achieve good accuracy on the test data, training examples must be sufficiently representative of the test data.  Introduction • Decision tree learning is one of the most widely used techniques for classification.  • Its classification accuracy is competitive with other methods, and • it is very efficient.  • The classification model is a tree, called decision tree.  CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 15 • C4.5 by Ross Quinlan is perhaps the best known system. It can be downloaded from the Web.  The loan data (reproduced) Approved or not CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 16  CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 17 A decision tree from the loan data ◼ Decision nodes and leaf nodes (classes)  CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 18 Use the No CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 19 decision tree CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 20 Is the decision tree unique? ◼ No. Here is a simpler tree.  ◼ We want smaller tree and accurate tree. ◼ Easy to understand and perform better.  ◼ Finding the best tree is NP-hard. ◼ All current tree building algorithms are heuristic algorithms CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 21 From a decision tree to a set of rules CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 22 ◼ A decision tree can be converted to a set of rules ◼ Each path from the root to a leaf is a rule. CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 23 Algorithm for decision tree learning • Basic algorithm (a greedy divide-and-conquer algorithm) • Assume attributes are categorical now (continuous attributes can be handled too) • Tree is constructed in a top-down recursive manner • At start, all the training examples are at the root • Examples are partitioned recursively based on selected attributes • Attributes are selected on the basis of an impurity function (e.g., information gain) • Conditions for stopping partitioning • All examples for a given node belong to the same class • There are no remaining attributes for further partitioning – majority class is the leaf CS583, Bing Liu, UIC 24 • There are no examples left  Evaluating classifiers • Outcome: • Accuracy • Confusion matrix • If cost-sensitive, the expected cost of classification ( attribute test cost + misclassification cost) etc.  Decision Trees Example tree  Edges : Attribute value tests Leaf nodes : Class predictions Example algorithms: ID3, C4.5, SPRINT, CART Diagram from Han-Kamber Intermediate nodes :  Attributes  Decision Tree schematic  Impure node, Select best attribute and continue Impure node, Select best attribute and continue Pure node, Leaf node: Class RED Training data set a1  a2  a3  a4  a5  a6  X Y Z  Decision Tree Issues How to avoid overfitting? Problem: Classifier performs well on training data, but fails How to determine the attribute for split? to give good results on test data How does the type of attribute affect the split?Alternatives: 1. Information Gain Example: Split on primary key gives pure nodes and good accuracy on training •Discrete-valued: Each branch corresponding to a value – not for testing •Gain (A, S) = Entropy (S) Continuous-valued: Each branch may be a range of values– Σ ( (Sj/S)*Entropy(Sj) )  Alternatives:(e.g.: splits may be age < 30, 30 < age < 50, age > 50 ) 1.( Other options: aimed at maximizing the gain/gain ratioPre- prune : Halting construction at a certain level of tree / ) Gain ratio, etc. level of purity 2. Post-prune : Remove a node if the error rate remains the same without it.
